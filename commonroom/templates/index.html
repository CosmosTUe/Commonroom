                    The Common Room is the community room for both AEGEE-Eindhoven and Cosmos.
                    We strive to keep it open during most academic days to provide a friendly space for everyone.
                    We have a kitchen for cooking, available all day.
                    Beyond that we also have barstools, tables and couches, creating a space for people to chill and talk together.
                    Furthermore, we have a projector with speakers and several board, card and computer games. 
                    We hope to see you around!
